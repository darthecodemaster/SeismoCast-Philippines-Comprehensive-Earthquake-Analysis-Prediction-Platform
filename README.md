# Earthquake Analysis and Magnitude Prediction in the Philippines (2016-2025)

The Philippines, situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly susceptible to seismic activity. Earthquakes are a frequent and significant natural hazard in the region, posing continuous threats to life and infrastructure.

Problem Statement
The unpredictable nature of earthquakes makes disaster preparedness challenging. While precise prediction is difficult, there is a clear gap in consolidated, cleaned regional datasets and robust predictive models that can help forecast earthquake magnitudes or identify high-risk areas based on historical PHIVOLCS data.

Objectives
Data Acquisition & Consolidation: Programmatically gather and unify historical earthquake data.
Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and extract temporal and historical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, trends, and spatial concentrations of seismic events.
Geospatial Analysis: Identify distinct seismic zones using clustering algorithms.
Predictive Modeling: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict earthquake magnitudes.
Approach
This project follows a structured data science methodology: scraping data from PHIVOLCS, conducting rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering, performing EDA and geospatial clustering, and finally developing a tuned Random Forest Regressor for magnitude prediction.
